## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Bashnota Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior. (Note: A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` should be created).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure it hasn't been reported yet by searching the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/bashnota/issues).

If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-repo/bashnota/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, please create an issue with a clear title and description. Explain why this enhancement would be useful and provide as much detail as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Bashnota? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/your-repo/bashnota/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-repo/bashnota/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issues`.

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1.  **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up Bashnota for local development.

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bashnota.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate** to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd bashnota
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies** for the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Start the local Supabase services**:
    ```bash
    npm run supabase:start
    npm run supabase:reset
    ```
6.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the frontend application. You should be able to access it at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

Now you're ready to make your changes!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. This allows for automated changelog generation and helps keep the commit history clean and readable.

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example: `feat(editor): add new youtube block extension`

### Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent code style. Please make sure to run the linter before submitting a pull request.

-   `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.
-   `npm run format` to automatically format your code.

By following these guidelines, you'll help us keep the project maintainable and easy to contribute to. Thank you again for your interest in Bashnota!
