 * `NodeView` contract. Node-view bugs surface as cursor jumps, swallowed
 * keystrokes and lost selection — the hardest editor bugs to diagnose — so every
 * contract member below documents exactly what breaks if it is wrong.
 *
 * Rendering mirrors @tiptap/vue-3's VueRenderer: a reactive props object passed
 * to `h(component, props)`, rendered with Vue's low-level `render(vNode, el)`,
 * and torn down with `render(null, el)`. When an `appContext` is supplied the
 * mounted component inherits the host app's plugins/provides (Pinia, global
 * components), exactly as TipTap threads `editor.appContext`.
