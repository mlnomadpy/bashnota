/**
 * EditorRegistry — the plugin/command registry.
 *
 * Replaces two TipTap surfaces at once:
 * - `addProseMirrorPlugins` — plugins are native ProseMirror already, so we just
 *   collect them and hand the flat list to the EditorState.
 * - `addCommands` — TipTap commands become plain ProseMirror `Command`s
 *   `(state, dispatch?, view?) => boolean`, registered by name and runnable
 *   against a view.
 *
 * Keeping both in one registry gives each block a single place to contribute its
 * behaviour, and gives `useEditor` a single place to read it from.
